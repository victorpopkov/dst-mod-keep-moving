# Installation

## Steam Workshop

The easiest way to install this mod is by subscribing to it using the Steam
Workshop: [https://steamcommunity.com/app/322330/workshop/][]

This way the mod can be automatically updated upon a new version release by
using the in-game **Mods** submenu.

## Manually

If you would like to install the mod manually for example on devices where you
don't have access to the [Steam Workshop][] you can:

1. Download either the **Source code** or **Workshop** version from the [Releases][] page.
2. Unpack the archive and move it to the game mods' directory.

Keep in mind, that you will need to manually update the mod each time a new
version has been released.
